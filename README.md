## History and Introduction

* Go is a procedural programming language. It was developed in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson at Google but launched in 2009 as an open-source programming language


* Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. 
* Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction.

* It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language

## History and Introduction

* Go is a procedural programming language. It was developed in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson at Google but launched in 2009 as an open-source programming language

* Programs are assembled by using packages, for efficient management of dependencies. 
* This language also supports environment adopting patterns alike to dynamic languages. 
* For eg., type inference (y := 0 is a valid declaration of a variable y of type int).

* Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. 

* It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language

* Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction.

### Concurrency:
* Go is known for its support for concurrency, which is the ability to run multiple tasks simultaneously. 
* Concurrency is achieved in Go through the use of __Goroutines__ and __Channels__, which allow you to write code that can run multiple operations at the same time. 
* This makes Go an __ideal choice for building high-performance and scalable network services,__ as well as for solving complex computational problems.

### Garbage collection:
* Another important feature of Go is its garbage collection, which automatically manages memory for you. 
* This __eliminates the need for manual memory management,__ reducing the likelihood of memory leaks and other bugs that can arise from manual memory management.

### Some features to highlight:

1. Simplicity: Go is designed to be easy to learn and use. Its syntax is simple and straightforward, making it a good choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.

2. Concurrency: Go has built-in support for concurrency, allowing developers to write efficient and scalable code for multicore and distributed systems.


3. Garbage collection: Go has automatic memory management, which frees developers from having to worry about memory allocation and deallocation.

4. Fast compile times: Go has a fast compiler, which makes it easy to iterate quickly during development.

5. Cross-platform support: Go can be compiled to run on many different platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.

6. Strong typing: Go is a statically typed language, which helps catch errors at compile time rather than at runtime.

7. Go has a large and growing community of developers and is used by many well-known companies, including Google, Uber, and Dropbox.
